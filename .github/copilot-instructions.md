# Chat Behavior

- Keep responses concise and direct — no unnecessary explanations or filler
- Before answering, read the project structure, search api and existing files first
- Use existing project files, patterns, and tools before suggesting new ones
- Never guess — if unsure and the tasks is complicate, search the codebase or ask for clarification
- simple tasks should be solved with simple solutions.
- Don't repeat code that already exists in the project
- If not confident about a solution, provide a reference link or official documentation URL
- When suggesting libraries or tools, always search for the latest version first — or ask me which version to use

# Code Style

- Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable and function names
- Optimize for performance where possible without sacrificing readability
- Follow the conventions and patterns already used in the project
- Don't introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary

# Terminal Commands

- On Windows: always use PowerShell syntax, use cmd please ask first
- On macOS/Linux: always use bash/zsh syntax

# General Rules

- Don't over-engineer — keep solutions simple
- Show only what changed, not the entire file
- If something is wrong in existing code, mention it
- Always prefer official documentation over blog posts or Stack Overflow
- When in doubt, ask — don't assume
